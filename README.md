# Turborepo example Terraform CDK infrastructure with AWS and Vercel deployments

This is an official starter turborepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a packages manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages
- `api`: a Lambda function
- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinanbekar/turborepo-terraform-cdk-aws-vercel

### Build
